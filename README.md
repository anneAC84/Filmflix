## Project Overview

**Filmflix** is a dynamic movie management application designed to provide users with a platform to explore, upload, and interact with films. Users can view a comprehensive list of movies, create new entries, edit existing ones, and engage with the content by liking films. Non-registered users can browse movies, while registered users gain additional privileges such as creating, updating, deleting, and liking movies. The intuitive interface ensures an enjoyable and seamless browsing experience for all users.

### Future Enhancements
- **User Reviews**: Allow logged-in users to review and rate films.
- **Search Functionality**: Implement a search bar to filter movies by title, genre, or director.
- **Trailer Links**: Add an option to include YouTube or external links to movie trailers.
- **Improved User Profiles**: Enable users to view a list of movies they have uploaded, liked, or reviewed.
