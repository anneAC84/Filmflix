Project Overview

Filmflix is a dynamic movie management application designed to provide users with a platform to explore, upload, and interact with films. Users can view a comprehensive list of movies, create new entries, edit existing ones, and engage with the content by liking films. Non-registered users have the ability to browse movies, while registered users gain additional privileges such as creating, updating, deleting, and liking movies. The intuitive interface ensures an enjoyable and seamless browsing experience for all users.

Future Enhancements include adding features for logged-in users to review films, implementing a search function to filter movie listings, and integrating external links for watching trailers.
