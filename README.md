The name of my app is called Filmflix.

It is an app where you are able to upload and browse movies and interact with other users by liking films. As a none logged in user, you are able to to view movies, as a login in user you are able to view movies, create, update and delete films.  You are also able to 'like' films.


To enhance the app there are many things I would like to add, for instance the ability for logged in users to review a film a serch function and the ability to create a link to watch trailers.
